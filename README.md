Crypto Arbitrage Detector is a real-time analytical platform built with Streamlit to detect arbitrage opportunities across multiple cryptocurrency exchanges. It continuously scrapes live price data, analyzes spreads, and evaluates profitability and risk based on configurable thresholds. While the dashboard offers detailed insights and statistical metrics, it’s important to note that it is primarily designed for educational purposes, and signal simulation. Due to the nature of financial markets, actual arbitrage opportunities are often corrected within milliseconds, making manual execution virtually impossible. Exploiting these inefficiencies in practice would require ultra-low latency infrastructure and high-frequency trading systems. This tool, however, provides a solid foundation for backtesting strategies, and understanding market inefficiencies — potentially serving as a prototype for future HFT system integration.
